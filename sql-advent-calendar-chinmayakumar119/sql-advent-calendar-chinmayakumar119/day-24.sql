-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH goals AS (
  SELECT 
  user_id,
  user_type,
  COUNT(goal_id) AS goals_completed
FROM
   user_goals
WHERE goal_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY  user_id,user_type)
SELECT user_type,
AVG(goals_completed)
FROM goals
GROUP BY  user_type;
